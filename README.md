Companies like Blinkit E-commerce generate large volumes of sales and marketing data daily, but analyzing this data to extract actionable insights is challenging. Sales, revenue, product performance, and customer behavior are often scattered across multiple sources, making it difficult to track trends over time. Without proper analysis, it is hard to understand which products, customer segments, and marketing channels are driving revenue, identify growth opportunities, or make data-driven decisions to optimize sales and marketing strategies.
